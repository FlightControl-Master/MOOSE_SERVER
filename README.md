# MOOSE_SERVER
MOOSE for servers ....


HubJack: This is WIP and is not useful at the moment. Work is done on the code every day but running tests and debugging on private server. Master will be updated as soon as a new tested version is running stable on the private server. So for now please comment and contribute but be careful if you plan to use the master build.

The project aims to create a statistics central for flight logging based on each pilotâ€™s flight time. Statistics will be focused on teamwork rather than individual performance. The MOOSE Server Statistics project will provide all code to locally create the needed .csv files. The webpage and MySQL setup is highly individual and will not be provided in the GitHub MOOSE Server project. If your team plan on setting up a DCS World statistics page based on APACHE, MySQL(MariaDB), PHP and FTP we may give information on how to get started. Please contact us at Slack MOOSE.

MOOSE SERVER DONE: Export of Mission data, player data and event data. Still testing....
MOOSE SERVER WIP: Error logging, reading local server info, programming past DCS bugs, 

WEBSITE WIP: adjusting info export to .csv files, preparing file transport to webserver, testing MySQL server import, building MySQL views, creating simple stats webpage in PHP. 

Regards, HubJack
